Project/App Title: UVa Bucket List

Basic Instructions on Usage: 
- The opening screen of the application will show a default bucket list of a few pre filled items to complete before graduation. There will be three options: to click on an item to edit it, to check an item off to signify completion, or to click the plus sign to add a new item. 
- Tapping on the button at the right bottom corner gives you an "Add" screen. You can edit Name, Description, Latitude, Longitude and Date. Tap the "SAVE NEW ITEM" button to save the item you just add. If you don't want to add a new item, click on the back arrow at the left top corner, and then you will go back to the main list.
- Clicking on the item gives you an "Edit" screen. You can edit Name, Description, Latitude, Longitude and Date. Tap the "SAVE CHANGES" button to save the item you just edit. If you don't want to edit that item, click on the back arrow at the left top corner, and then you will go back to the main list.
-Clicking on the box, you can check or uncheck items. If you check one item, it will go to the bottom of the list. If you you uncheck one item, it will go back to the right position sorted by date.

Lessons Learned: 
Throughout this project, we learned many lessons about android development. First of all, this is not only a good practice of what we learned in class but also a big challenge to apply those techniques and combine them together in this app. One thing I learned in this process is that we have to have a very clear notion about the structure of the app and very strong knowledge about fuctions of each example taught in class. These two aspects make the progress of designing and then implementing an application much easier.  

Also, there are some new challenges, such as using calendar and creating a smart tool bar. I learned that there are many resources online for resolving these challenges. Most of the times when I got an error, or wanted to figure  projout how to add a feature, googling the question successfully found me an answer. This is useful to know because I would like to use the knowledge gained in this class in the future to develop my ownects.
